# Checkr Name Matching

###### At Checkr, one of the most important aspects of our work is accurately matching records to candidates. One of the ways that we do this is by comparing the name on a given record to a list of known aliases for the candidate. In this exercise, we will implement a `name_match` method that accepts the list of known aliases as well as the name returned on a record. It should return True if the name matches any of the aliases and False otherwise.

# Future Development:

###### 1) Transposition (swapping) of the first name and middle name is relatively common.In order to accurately match the name returned from a record we should take this into account.All of the test cases implemented previously also apply to the transposed name.

###### 2) First name and middle name can be transposed

###### 3) Last name cannot be transposed
